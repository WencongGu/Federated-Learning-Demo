# Federated-Learning-Demo

Hi, my friend! No matter who you are, since you are checking this repository, I believe you are really interested in ML. 

This is my code practicing on some ***deep learing*** algorithoms, mainly focus on ***outliers detective***, with attention to ***privacy preserving*** (***Federated Learning***). 

I have to say, as a undergraduate student, this project seems to be naive, and in some particular aspects it may appears to be whimsical.

I know this is not even a start to the latest results, but you got to start from the beginning.

I've made up mind to devote myself into the searching of algorithms. Given my background of training, I maybe working on ML with privacy preserving.

If you're too intrested in ML, welcome to grab some code in this repository! I'm more than glad if this can help you!
